## Features

Implemented responsiveness and mobile menu for better UI.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DmytroZhdanov/learn-lingo.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser (Note: the port may be
   changed if 5173 port is occupied by another website).
6. To stop your local server enter in CLI: `control` + `C` for Mac or `CNTRL` + `C` for Windows.


<!-- Or if you want to use Docker, follow these steps (Note: You must have installed Docker app on your
computer):

1. Open CLI and enter the command:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --rm -p 5173:[port] --name car-rent dmytrozhdanov/car-rent
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:[port]](http://localhost:[port]) in your browser.
4. To stop your local server enter in CLI:
   ```bash
   docker stop car-rent
   ```
   It will automatically delete the container.
  
   Replace `[port]` with desired port. You may replace it with the same `5173` port if it's not
   occupied currently by another website. -->
